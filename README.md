This is all the code behind my personal website and portfolio.

## Information
All code is written by me, Jeremy Swinnen. I'm a designer and creative developer from Belgium. I design digital products and web experiences for and with people from all over the world.

While I'm primarily a designer, I do enjoy coding the designs I create. I believe it helps me grow as a designer in general. Some of the code you're seeing here may contain some faults and not-so-clever ways of doing things. But hey, I feel like I'm constantly improving my skills, so that's a good thing, right?
