> My fave part about my own site is I get to use it to experiment w/the latest & greatest features. I learn many things by applying them on my own site first.

I've been building my own portfolio for the past few years and I can't agree more with this. It is my own site where I learned how to properly use CSS Grid. It is my own site where I learned how to properly use CSS Variables and, it is my own site where I learned how to utilize continuous deployment by combining Zeit or Netlify with Github for hosting.

My own site not only serves as my portfolio and journal, it serves as a playground for me to experiment with new technologies and learn from them. This is huge for me and you should consider building your own site if you're interested in these kinds of things.
