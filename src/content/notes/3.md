People have been complaining quite a bit over the past few months regarding the quality of games Sony adds for PlayStation Plus subscribers. Backlash was especially noticable for this month's offerings: *Pro Evolution Soccer 2019* and *Horizon Chase Turbo*. I'm not particularly interested in these games, but the 'free' games are not why I'm a Plus subscriber.

Either way, Sony made the right call and posted [an update on their PlayStation Blog](https://blog.eu.playstation.com/2019/07/02/detroit-become-human-and-horizon-chase-turbo-are-your-playstation-plus-games-for-july/):
> We are making a swap to the PS Plus games lineup for July. This month, we are adding Detroit: Become Human Digital Deluxe Edition, which also includes Heavy Rain, to the July games lineup instead of Pro Evolution Soccer 2019. We apologise for any inconvenience.

While I've not yet played Detroit, I'm particularly curious to see next month's offerings.
