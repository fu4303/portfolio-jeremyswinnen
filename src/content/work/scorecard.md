lede: In collaboration with Lickability, I created a fun and intuitive way to keep score while playing games with friends & family.

### The Challenge
After working on Shelf in the second half of 2017, Lickability contacted me again in Late 2018 to work on Scorecard. The app’s goals are to make the act of keeping score while playing boardgames fun again.

### My Approach
Working together with Lickability is always a streamlined process. Since there was a first version in place, it was quite easy for me to iterate on that. Most of the structure of the app was already in place, it just needed a visual refresh.

I started in Figma laying out all the components currently present in the app and created a pattern library from there. Everything from user interface chrome, buttons, icons, and colors is defined as a ‘component’ in this document so it’s easily accessible with me and the developers at Lickability. Since this document acts as a ‘source of truth’, it really simplified the development process of the developers.
