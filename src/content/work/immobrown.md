### Summary
Immo Brown is an exclusive real estate agency based in West-Flanders, Belgium. Their website was in dire need of a redesign to reposition the agency back on top in this competitive market. I had around 2 weeks time to redesign their site and marketing direction. From the very beginning, I opted to design their website with a mobile-first approach in mind.

By using dark colors combined with simple iconography, I created a luxury look for them. The result is a responsive, modern website that perfectly showcases their portfolio.

Over the course of those 2 weeks, I communicated with the client to make sure we were on the same level. If something was not to their liking, weâ€™d sit down and explore other options. 

After my design was completed, it was handed over to the development team.

### Result
When development of the website was finished, the new website was launched to positive feedback from new and existing clients. The new design does a good job on highlighting properties by presenting the user with large pictures and well-structured data.
