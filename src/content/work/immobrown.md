While working as a designer at FW4, one of the first projects I did was Immo Brown. This exclusive real estate agent was in dire need of a modern website to present their real estate portfolio.

By using dark colors combined with simple iconography I created a luxury look for them. The result is a responsive, modern website that perfectly showcases their portfolio.
