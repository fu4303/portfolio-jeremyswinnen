    description: Is your app in need of a thorough redesign of its UI? I'm experienced with iOS and Android and can create detailed and native experiences for your mobile users. I'm loyal to the platform I'm designing for and my eye for detail makes your product stand out in the crowd.
  - title: Front-end Code
    description: With a big focus on valid HTML, clean code, and accessibility, I'm able to code my designs and make sure they perform like a champ on the web. I can work with various CSS preprocessors as well as new techniques like CSS variables. As for publishing a site, I have worked with Wordpress, Magento, and a variety of static-site-generators such as Jekyll, Eleventy, MiddleMan, and more.
  - title: Responsive Web Design
    description: I like to work with a mobile-first approach to ensure mobile users get a full-featured version of your website instead of a narrowed-down one. Using modular code, I can make small adjustments that have a big impact on how your site performs across devices and resolutions.
  - title: Consulting
    description: Are you looking for someone with a strong and educated opinion across a wide range of design principles? I can guide your team back on track to ensure great success in the market you're operating in. I take a look at your current product or marketing efforts and can provide a detailed report with guidelines where to improve and adjust.

### How I like to work
I aim to be as straightforward and direct as possible while designing. I communicate clearly and often throughout the design process. Depending on the scale of the project, I’m able to deliver the first mockups in about 2 weeks time. When those are approved, I quickly move to high-fidelity mockups with multiple stages of prototyping in between to make sure we’re on the right track.
When the design is approved, I can convert my work into a working website by writing modular and valid code. If needed, integrating with a CMS is also an option. I'm experienced with various popular CMS as well as static content generators.

### Who hires me
I am typically hired by individuals and small organisations in the tech and real estate business. They often need someone with a strong visual eye, who is capable of delivering both visual and technical work in a timely manner.

### How you can hire me
The best way to hire me is to simply send me an email with some info about yourself and your project. You can expect an answer from me within 48 hours. My email is [hello@jeremyswinnen.co](https://www.porsche.com).
