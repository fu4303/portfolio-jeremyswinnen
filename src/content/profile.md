#### How I like to work
I aim to be as straightforward and direct as possible while designing. I communicate clearly and often throughout the design process. Depending on the scale of the project, I’m able to deliver the first mockups in about 2 weeks time. When those are approved, I quickly move to high-fidelity mockups with multiple stages of prototyping in between to make sure we’re on the right track.
When the design is approved, I can convert my work into a working website by writing modular and valid code. If needed, integrating with a CMS is also an option. I'm experienced with various popular CMS as well as static content generators.

#### Who hires me
I am typically hired by individuals and small organisations in the tech and real estate business. They often need someone with a strong visual eye, who is capable of delivering both visual and technical work in a timely manner.

#### How you can hire me
The best way to hire me is to simply send me an email with some info about yourself and your project. You can expect an answer from me within 48 hours. My email is [hello@jeremyswinnen.co](https://www.porsche.com).
